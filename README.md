# Stroke-Prediction-model-HealthCare
I  propose a predictive analytics approach for stroke prediction. 
I use machine learning and neural networks in the proposed approach. 
Age, heart disease, average glucose level are important factors for predicting stroke.
I also report our results on different types of Classifiers and their accuracy score too..
The steps I followed is below :


Import pandas and Numpy, pandas etc
Import the dataset
Check the shape 
Check the info 
Drop unwanted columns like “ID” if any 
Change the data types to their correct format 
Get all the categorical columns into a new list
Get all the numerical columns into a new list 


Perform univariance analysis of numerical columns using kdeplot 
Perform univariance analysis of categorical column using hisplot and countplot 
Perform bivariance analysis of numerical columns with barchart, scatterplot 


Check for nulls 
Treat the nulls 
Check for duplicates 
Treat the duplicates 
Check for outliers 
Treat the outliers 
Check for imbalance 
Treat the imbalance.


Load the models 
Build up the models 
Provide result.
